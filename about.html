<p>Hello my name is Dimitri, known online as DimeDimovski. I like tech, cars, planes, helicopters, video games and so on. I enjoy programming whenever it isn't mandatory or it's a passion project I enjoy.</p>

<h2>Talking about my interests in tech</h2>
<p>I'll start with talking about my interest in tech. While programming intruiges me I am far more interested in physical tech like phones, graphics cards and such. Software like Windows and Linux also fascinate me. My favorite phone as of September 2024 is the <b>Vivo X100 Ultra</b>. Like imagine having a phone that can take as good pics as a DSLR camera, that's cool. My current phone is a Galaxy S8, which is a bit dated but I don't mind.</p>

<h2>Talking about cars</h2>
<p>My love for cars had existed since I was a little boy, but reignited last year when I turned 16 and was now legally allowed to take driver's lessons. My lowly standards led to me wanting a Suzuki Swift (the first gen), with me later transitioning into a E46 320d, which would put me down a rabbit hole of the E46 M3, and would introduce me to the <b>BMW M3 GTR</b> via Need for Speed: Most Wanted. I really like this game, currently as I'm writing this I'm at Blacklist Level 5, with me now trying to mentally prepare myself to finally beat him and move on to the other Blacklist members (I'll mention them in my phobias later). I have 28 Hours in the game according to Lutris but I'm sure I've put more than that, I've resetted my progress multiple times because the original copy I had of the game was straight trash, and now I finally found one with HD graphics too. I like the mod so much I don't have a single car in my garage from the ones that came originally with the game (Ford Puma for racing, Trans Am for cop chases,Bumblebee Camaro for drag racing).</p>

<h2>Talking about planes and helicopters</h2>
<p>I've always loved planes and helicopters. My love comes from Battlefield 2 because of how fun it is to play with the fighters in that game. My favorite jet in the game is the <b>F-15E Strike Eagle</b> which I can't call a fighter because it isn't, even though it is clearly based on one. As for helicopters I really like the <b>Bell 206</b> and <b>MD-530F Littlebird</b>, especially the Littlebird because of how deadly it is yet small and agile.</p>
